Redis needs no introduction. It is a widely deployed data-structure server. In this post today, let's try to build the Redis project from source and play around with it a bit.

## Getting Redis
---

Like most open-source software, Redis is also hosted on Github. Head on to **https://github.com/redis/redis** and clone the repository, using either the *HTTPS or SSH* options.

## Building Redis
---

In order to build **Redis** and play with it, let's use our docker playground environment that we previously created here, [setup my docker playground]({{site.baseurl}}/dockerize/ "docker up my playground")

Most of the dependencies required to build and run the project, are already setup as part of the docker based playground.

Map the volume where **Redis** was cloned on your host system, onto your **docker-compose.yml** file as below:

```
version: '3.7'

services:
  go-app:
    ...
    ...
    ...
    volumes:
      ...
      ...
      - /Users/dipankar/Workspace/redis:/webapps/redis:delegated
    ...
    ...
    ...
```

Once the mapped volume is available in your docker instance, we can build **Redis** from the ground up. You will most linkely need to re-start your container after changing the above **docker-compose.yml** file.

With all of the above done, we can now connect to the shell interface of our running image instance (a.k.a the container). Type below command in your terminal window.

```
$ docker exec -it project-root_go-app_1 bash
```

Once inside the container's shell interface, we can navigate to the mapped redis directory. Now if you've followed along our previous docker playground setup blog post, it should be **/webapps/redis/**.

From inside this redis root directory, we can execute the **make** command to build redis from the source. Run the below command like so,

```
bash-5.0# make CFLAGS="-ggdb -Og -g3 -fno-omit-frame-pointer"
```

The **CFLAGS** option tells the **make** command to minimize the optimizations done by the compiler (GCC in our case), when building redis. This allows us to transparently inspect the run-time state when using a gdb based debugging session.
